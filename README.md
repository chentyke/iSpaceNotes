# iSpaceNotes

Welcome to the GitHub repository of `iSpaceNotes`! This is a tool designed to help business students manage learning materials and notes more efficiently.

## About the project

`iSpaceNotes` is a small project I developed in order to better organize and review the content of the business course during my learning process. Although it is just a UI interface without actual functions, I hope you like it.

## Developer's words

Thank you very much for your attention and support to `iSpaceNotes`! As a student developer who has just started programming, I know that there are still many things that need to be improved and perfected in this project.
